# PostgreSQL Integration with Node.js and Express

`PostgreSQL` is a `powerful`, `open-source`, `object-relational` database system. Node.js can interact with PostgreSQL using libraries like `pg`, which is a `PostgreSQL client` for Node.js.

## Prerequisites
- `Node.js` and `npm` installed
- `PostgreSQL` installed and running
- A basic understanding of JavaScript and Express

## Step-by-Step Guide
## 1. Installs express and pg external Modules

```bash
npm install express pg
```

**Explanation**: Initializes a new Node.js project and installs `express` and `pg` (the PostgreSQL client).

---

## 2. Set Up PostgreSQL

### Create a database and a table using the PostgreSQL CLI or any GUI tool like pgAdmin.

Creating Database and Table using pgAdmin

### Steps

1. Open **pgAdmin**.
2. From the left sidebar, click on **Servers**.
3. A **Connect to Server** window will open and ask for the root user password given during installation. Enter the password and click **OK**.
4. It will connect to the PostgreSQL Server.
5. In the left sidebar, you will see a default database named **postgres**.
6. Right-click on the default server name **PostgreSQL**, then select **Create** ‚Üí **Database**.
7. A new window will open. Enter the name for your database, e.g., `testdb`, and click **OK**.
8. Right-click on your new database name (`testdb`), then select **Query Tool**. This will open a query window where you can write PostgreSQL queries.
9. Copy and paste the below **CREATE TABLE** query into the Query Tool window, select the query, and click the **Run** button from the top ribbon.


```sql

CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);
```

**Explanation**: This creates a `users` table with `id`, `name`, and `email` columns.

---

## 3. Connect Node.js to PostgreSQL
**Database Connection Setup**
Create a new file named `db.js` in the same folder and Paste the below code.

```js
const { Pool } = require('pg');

const pool = new Pool({
    user: 'postgres',
    host: 'localhost',
    database: 'testdb',
    password: 'your_password',
    port: 5432,
});

module.exports = pool;
```
This file sets up a **connection pool** to a PostgreSQL database using the `pg` (node-postgres) library in Node.js. It allows the application to **interact with the database** efficiently.


**Explanation**: 
 - `pg.Pool`: A `class` from pg that handles a `pool` of database connections, allowing multiple queries without reconnecting each time (better performance and scalability). Replace credentials with your PostgreSQL config.

**üõ† Configuration Parameters**

| Key      | Description                                                               |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| user     | Your PostgreSQL `username`                                                  |
| host     | The database server location, typically **'localhost'** for local development |
| database | The **name of the PostgreSQL database** you want to connect to (e.g., testdb) |
| password | The `password` for the specified PostgreSQL user                            |
| port     | Default PostgreSQL port is `5432`                                           |

‚û°Ô∏è Note: 
   - You must replace `your_pg_user` and `your_password` with actual PostgreSQL credentials. 
   - To check these credentials in pgAdmin, follow the steps below:
    - In pgAdmin, `right-click` on the `server` where your database is located from the left sidebar.
    - Select `Properties`.
    - A new window will open. Switch to the `Connection` tab to view the **connection details**.


### üîÅ What is a "Pool of Database Connections"?

A `connection pool` is a **managed collection of reusable connections to a database**. Instead of creating a new connection every time you run a query (which is `slow` and resource-intensive), a pool keeps a set of connections open and hands them out when needed.
  - When you create a new `Pool()` from the pg library, it uses some **default settings**.
  - At most, `10 connections` can be `created` and `reused` at any given time.
  - If all are busy and another query comes in, it `waits` until one is free (or times out).
  - You can customize the pool by using a key called `max` (max: 20)

Think of it like a shared taxi service:
  - Instead of everyone driving their own car (making their own DB connection),
  - A few cars (connections) are available to pick up people (queries) as needed.

## 4. Create Express Server

**Create a File named `server.js` and Import the required modules and Add the Middleware**

```js
const express = require('express');
const pool = require('./db');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json()); // Middleware to parse JSON
```

**Express Initialization**

- `express()` creates an instance of the Express application.
- `express.json()` is middleware that parses incoming requests with JSON payloads.

---

## üì§ GET `/users` - Retrieve All Users from the users Table

```js
app.get('/users', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const result = await pool.query('SELECT * FROM users');
        res.json(result.rows);
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(err.message);
    }
});
```
### üîç Explanation
  - Runs a simple `SELECT * FROM users` query.
  - Sends all user records as JSON.

---

## üì• POST `/users` - 

This `Route`/`Endpoint` to Add a New User to the users table by accepting data `{ name, email }` from the Client via Payload.

```js
app.post('/users', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const { name, email } = req.body;
        const result = await pool.query(
            'INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ($1, $2) RETURNING *',
            [name, email]
        );
        res.json(result.rows[0]);
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(err.message);
    }
});
```

### üîç Explanation

- Reads `name` and `email` from the request body (`req.body`).
- Executes a parameterized SQL query using the pool (Database Connection Object):
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ($1, $2)
  ```
- `RETURNING *` returns the inserted row.
- `res.json(result.rows[0])` sends the created user as JSON.

---


**Summary**:
- `/users` (GET) retrieves all users.
- `/users` (POST) adds a new user to the database.
- `pool.query()` is used to run SQL queries.
- `express.json()` middleware parses incoming JSON requests.

---

## 5. Test the API

Use Postman or `curl` to test the endpoints.

### Example POST request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/users -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"name\": \"John Doe\", \"email\": \"john@example.com\"}"
```

**Explanation**: 
To run this open any terminal and copy paste and press enter. Then it Sends a POST request to insert a new user into the database.

---

## üìù Notes

- Make sure you have a `users` table in your PostgreSQL DB with at least `name` and `email` columns.

## Conclusion

You‚Äôve now integrated PostgreSQL into a Node.js + Express application. With this setup, you can perform CRUD operations and build scalable backend APIs.
