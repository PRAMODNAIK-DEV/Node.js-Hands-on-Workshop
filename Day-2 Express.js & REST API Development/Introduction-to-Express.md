## ðŸ”¶ Introduction to Express.js

### What is Express.js?
Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a **robust set of features** for building web applications and APIs. It simplifies server-side development by handling `routing`, `middleware`, and `HTTP` `request`/`response` **management efficiently**.


### ðŸ§± Why Install Express?
- Node.js comes with a built-in `http` or `https` module to create servers, but it's low-level. You have to handle:
- Routing manually (req.url and req.method)
- Parsing request bodies
- Setting response headers
- Error handling, etc.

That can become `tedious` and `repetitive`.

### Advantages of Express over default `http`/`https` module?
Express is a popular framework **built on top of Node's `http` module**. It simplifies backend development.
- `Lightweight & Fast`: Minimal setup and optimized performance.
- `Middleware Support`: Easily integrate third-party middleware for functionalities like `authentication`, `logging`, and `error handling`.
- `Routing System`: Provides a robust and easy-to-use routing mechanism.
- `Scalability`: Suitable for both small-scale and enterprise-level applications.
- `Template Engines`: Supports various templating engines like EJS, Pug, and Handlebars.


### Installing Express
```bash
npm init -y
npm install express
```

#### Why do we need to Install Express:
Express is a **`third-party` package**
- It is not part of Node.js core.
- It's developed and maintained outside the official Node.js runtime by the **open-source community.**
- You get it via `npm` (Node Package Manager), which is the standard way to install third-party libraries in Node.js.

### Basic Express Server Example
```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

const PORT = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, Express!');
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

### Key Concepts
- **Routing**: Define how the app `responds` to client `requests`.
- **Middleware**: Functions that execute during the `request-response` cycle.
- **Request & Response Objects**: Used to handle HTTP requests and responses.

### Features
- Easy to configure and customize
- Supports dynamic routing and templating engines
- Good integration with databases, file uploads, and more

# ðŸ“Œ API Routing in Express.js

In Express.js, routing refers to **how your application responds to client requests to specific endpoints (URLs)** using **HTTP methods** such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, etc.

## Basic Routing

### Example:
```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Welcome to the Home Page!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

### Explanation:
- `app.get()` defines a route for `GET` requests to the root `/` URL.
- The callback function `(req, res)` handles the request and sends a response.

## âœ… Route Methods

Express provides methods to handle different HTTP requests:

- `app.get()` â€“ Read data
- `app.post()` â€“ Create data
- `app.put()` â€“ Update data completely.
- `app.patch()` â€“ Update just a few fields
- `app.delete()` â€“ Delete data
