# Middleware in Node.js and Express

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. They can:

- Execute any code.
- Modify the request and the response objects.
- End the request-response cycle.
- Call the next middleware function in the stack.

## Types of Middleware

1. **Application-level middleware**: Functions that are bound to an instance of the Express app and handle requests for all or specific routes.
2. **Router-level middleware**: Similar to application-level middleware but bound to an instance of `express.Router()`, allowing modular route handling.
3. **Error-handling middleware**: Middleware that takes four arguments `(err, req, res, next)` and is used to catch and process errors in the app.
4. **Built-in middleware**: Middleware functions provided by Express (e.g., express.json(), express.static()) to handle common tasks.
5. **Third-party middleware**: External middleware installed via npm (e.g., body-parser, cors) to add additional functionality to Express apps.

## 1. Custom Middleware

Custom middleware functions are user-defined and are often used to perform tasks such as logging, authentication, or request validation.

### Example: Logging Middleware

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Custom middleware
const logger = (req, res, next) => {
    console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
    next(); // Pass control to the next handler
};

app.use(logger);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Home Page');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

### Example: Authentication Middleware

```js
const authenticate = (req, res, next) => {
    const auth = req.headers['authorization'];
    if (auth === 'secret-token') {
        next();
    } else {
        res.status(403).send('Forbidden');
    }
};

app.get('/protected', authenticate, (req, res) => {
    res.send('You are authorized');
});
```

## 2. Third-Party Middleware

These are middleware functions developed by the community and published as Node.js packages.

### Example: `morgan` for logging

```bash
npm install morgan
```

```js
const express = require('express');
const morgan = require('morgan');
const app = express();

app.use(morgan('combined'));

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Home Page');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

### Example: `body-parser` for parsing request bodies

Note: In modern Express versions, `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()` are built-in.

```bash
npm install body-parser
```

```js
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.post('/data', (req, res) => {
    res.send(`You sent: ${JSON.stringify(req.body)}`);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

## Best Practices

- Place error-handling middleware at the end of middleware definitions.
- Use `next(err)` to trigger error-handling middleware.
- Modularize middleware for scalability and clarity.

## Conclusion

Middleware in Express is powerful and extensible. Understanding how to use and implement both custom and third-party middleware is essential for building scalable and maintainable Node.js applications.
